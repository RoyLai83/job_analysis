Equipped with six SCIEX mass spectrometers and a super computer (800TB / 480 cores), ProCan processes          tumour samples through a proteomic method, SWATH-MS, which allows fast mass spectrometric conversion of small amounts of tissue (biopsy level) into a single, permanent digital file representing the quantitative proteome of the sample. One of          the goals of ProCan is to measure thousands of proteins in about 70,000 cancers of all types with known treatment outcome and correlate tumour proteotypes with clinical phenotypes. The Cancer Data Science Group aims to develop novel computational          tools and sophisticated machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal. Other major focuses of the group are 1) big proteogenomic data mining and management, 2) the genome-proteome association analysis and multi-omic data integration for studying          cancer, 3) development of advanced statistical tools to account for batch effects caused by large-scale, high throughput proteomics, and 4) implementation of big data-driven, evidence-based computational tools to achieve predictive, preventive,          personalized medicine.We invite applications from PhD scientists to join our group.
