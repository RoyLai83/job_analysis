          development and birth defects, cancer, neuroscience and gene therapy and we have a strong international reputation based on our research outcomes.  It is also home to the world-first proteomics project, ProCan, which is changing the way
          cancer is diagnosed and treated. CMRI’s research programs are supported by state of the art facilities and committed research and support staff. Our achievements are made possible by a loyal network of community supporters, highly engaged donors
          and the very successful Jeans for Genes® fundraising campaign. 
 
A data scientist position is available in the ProCan Cancer Data Science Group, led by Dr. Qing Zhong. ProCan (the ACRF International Centre for the Proteome of Human Cancer) is a world-first initiative developed and launched in September 2016
          by Professors Phil Robinson and Roger Reddel, and established with a $10 million grant from the Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF). Equipped with six SCIEX mass spectrometers and a super computer (800TB / 480 cores), ProCan processes
          tumour samples through a proteomic method, SWATH-MS, which allows fast mass spectrometric conversion of small amounts of tissue (biopsy level) into a single, permanent digital file representing the quantitative proteome of the sample. One of
          the goals of ProCan is to measure thousands of proteins in about 70,000 cancers of all types with known treatment outcome and correlate tumour proteotypes with clinical phenotypes. The Cancer Data Science Group aims to develop novel computational
          tools and sophisticated machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal. Other major focuses of the group are 1) big proteogenomic data mining and management, 2) the genome-proteome association analysis and multi-omic data integration for studying
          cancer, 3) development of advanced statistical tools to account for batch effects caused by large-scale, high throughput proteomics, and 4) implementation of big data-driven, evidence-based computational tools to achieve predictive, preventive,
          personalized medicine.
We invite applications from PhD scientists to join our group. Applicants should have a high degree of motivation in academic research, an excellent record of scientific accomplishments with publications in peer-reviewed journals, and the ability
          to work independently with outstanding communication and writing skills. Candidates should have a strong background in bioinformatics, biostatistics or machine learning. Strong programming skills in R and Python are required. Previous experience

675,Toll Holdings,Accounting,", Audit - Internal","
Who are we? 
The Toll Group is the Asian region's leading provider of integrated logistics services, generating annual revenue of AU$8.3 billion and employing over 40,000 people across an extensive network of 1,200 sites throughout more than 50 countries
            across the world. We’re committed to providing a safe, diverse, satisfying and fulfilling workplace for all of our people. We value integrity, trust, teamwork and being open and transparent. 
The opportunity  
Since 2017 Toll has been undergoing one of the largest changes in its 130-year history. We have been carefully rethinking the way we work and reorganising our operations into a customer-focused growth company. The work we are undertaking is
            making Toll a safer, simpler and stronger company, poised to achieve continued financial growth and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. As part of this journey, we are also undertaking an organisation-wide transformation of our
            risk culture and the company’s Business Assurance and Risk (BAR) function has been asked to take a leading role.
 
As the Data Analytics and Reporting Manager, you will support the success of Toll’s organisation-wide transformation. You will lead the development of innovative technologies and leverage large volumes of data to identify new risk exposures
            and provide valuable business insights to stakeholders.
 
In this role, you will work across the function’s enterprise risk management, internal audit and insurance disciplines, partnering together to generate new risk insights by effectively leveraging technology and internal and external data sources.
            You will be responsible for creating BAR’s data analytics strategy and implementing plans to achieve it. You will lead a small team of data analytics professionals, establish delivery standards and continuous improvement practices and operate
            processes for effective data extraction, data warehousing, business intelligence and reporting analysis. The role will own the end-to-end lifecycle for the function’s identification, use, dissemination and safeguarding of data. The role will
            also support the function’s governance and reporting activities.
 
Key accountabilities and responsibilities will include, but not be limited to:
Strategy
 

Working under the direction of the GM Governance, Analysis and Improvement, support the achievement of Toll’s strategic objectives with significant new risk insights that maximise the long-term sustainability of Toll’s profitability and return
              on capital. To achieve this, translate organisational and functional priorities into an integrated multi-year data analytics strategy. Translate the strategy into measurable plans and execute on it.
Directly facilitate the optimisation of synergies between the Enterprise Risk Management, Internal Audit and Insurance sub-functions to deliver significant business impact through effective data analysis and visualisation.
Contribute to the transformation of Toll’s risk culture.

 
Business Accountabilities
 

Meaningfully leverage data and data visualisation techniques to generate a significant impact on the sustainability of Toll’s profitability. In doing so, optimise synergies between BAR’s three sub-functions and multiple internal/external data
              sources to deliver new risk insights that help shape the views and actions of stakeholders.
Set a plan to promote and achieve buy-in amongst both business and BAR stakeholders on the value of pursuing a formalised data analytics approach to advancing business objectives. Achieve the plan by developing necessary capability, securing
              resources and delivering value-adding results.
Define and manage the function’s overall data governance and security processes.
Effectively and proactively engage with BAR team members globally to understand their project objectives. Translate these into scopes of work and detailed plans to deliver required analyses on time, budget and with a high degree of quality.
              Actively drive innovation in audit work by adding tangible value to each stage of the audit lifecycle with tailored analytics and effective business engagement.
Play a significant role in the function’s ability to deliver a ‘customer first’ approach with insightful, action-inspiring reporting and dashboards to key executive and Board stakeholders throughout the year. In doing so, analyse large volumes
              of disparate information to recognise relevant themes or issues and make connections that are not obvious to others. Provide clarity over complex business issues and be a catalyst for change by translating this work into recommendations
              for sustainable improvements in overall business outcomes.
Drive operational excellence by establishing and managing to leading standards, methodologies and processes for the data analytics department and its integration with both professional and functional standards. Continuously measure and innovate
              ways of working to improve cost, quality and business value.
Effectively manage all activities associated with data source identification (e.g. internal operational and financial systems or external sources), extraction, cleansing, analysis and reporting to meet project objectives. In doing so, engage
              with and manage the expectations of data owners, process experts, the IT function and internal BAR colleagues to deliver work to the highest professional standards and within budget.
Effectively collaborate with the external auditors to support their financial statement and J-Sox audits with data analysis in a way that helps to optimise their reliance on the function’s work for the financial and time benefit of the business.
Successfully manage assigned stakeholder relationships across the Group to build trust and confidence in assurance results to support sustainable financial and operational improvements.

 
People Leadership 
 

Contribute to maintaining a high-performance culture that supports career development in a safe and inclusive working environment.
Build, lead and develop a small team of data analysts.
Manage external co-source staff engagement processes and individual performance.

 
The ideal candidate?
 

Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) designation. Additional audit or risk qualifications will be highly regarded.

              messages.

Aptitude in working with new and legacy technologies, including Oracle or similar ERP environments.
Experience with regression analysis, predictive analytics, process flow analysis and machine learning would be advantageous.
Experience delivering data analytics for forensic reviews and audits of international regulatory compliance processes (e.g. anti-bribery/corruption, trade sanctions and embargoes, personal data privacy (e.g. GDPR), workplace safety, etc.).

We’re looking for a Sales Ops Manager to take control of six key aspects of our sales operations – commission management, reporting, on-boarding of new staff, sales enablement, inside sales campaigns and sales process. You’ll work with the best tools (CRMs, marketing automation, outreach, sales training and business intelligence), a growing and global team, with exposure to the C-suite. Above all, you’ll be the keeper of the revenue; tracking conversion rates, building out performance insights, and creating and maintaining consistency of process and data integrity across the team. What does it take to be a Noggin? At Noggin we have a very simple, but winning formula. We look for smart, driven people who want to be the best at their game. You self-teach, you’re curious, you’re independent but know how to leverage other resources, and you want to join a company that’s focused on excelling in this competitive world. You have ambitions, and we can clearly see career trajectory in your prior track record. We’re really looking for someone at the right point in their career trajectory – that means we want someone who’s done it before, most likely at a sales ops analyst level, and is looking to do it again. Someone who really wants a leg up with a growing company, and the opportunity to step up with that growth. Working in sales ops has made you highly organized, you thrive in a fast-paced environment, and you comfortably tackle change head on. And because we love data right up to the top of our business, your work will be regularly exposed to the c-suite, so you take pride in the presentation of your data sets, and your insights have depth and can withstand the challenge of a curious senior executive. What does success look like? Having worked in a sales ops environment for 3-5 years already, you’ll quickly pick up our systems, tools and processes and by month 3 you’ll already be on the track to inducting new members into the business development team, ensuring they understand who and how to engage with others at Noggin, and how our sales processes and reporting works. You’ll quickly get up to speed with Noggin’s sales incentives, and how we report on sales achievement and funnel health, so that by the time you hit your 6 month mark you’ll be comfortably helping sales leadership drive success around key milestones to increase acquisition and activation of accounts. We’ll support you along the way, guiding you on how to get the most out of forecasting meetings, on how to drive data integrity, and attention to metrics and performance.  So by month 9 we’re sure you’ll be comfortable with a baton change to independent work, driving key improvements and results in our sales operations and revenue position.

We want that too.Roles: Consultant, Senior Consultant (Sydney or Melbourne-based) We're about driving the very best outcomes for our clients, helping them lift their performance. Long experience says a critical ingredient is the best people - people of capability, resilience and judgement. Perhaps that's you. We deliver world leading*, award-winning, state-of-the-art business intelligence and corporate performance management (think budgets, forecasts, reporting and predictive analysis, except right, and meaningful, and actionable) for Finance, Operations and Executive Leadership. We love it. We really do. Our best people join us, and they stay, because:  Our work has variety- our days do not get monotonous. We (and with our clients) challenge each other in a supportive environment and work together. Though this we all become more than we were. We push the bounds of Microsoft tech, and we are not chained to our keyboards. You'll work with a variety of clients, industries and projects, and build your skill and experience. Our work is with Clients- understanding their needs and designing and implementing solutions that help them succeed. We get to use the CALUMO software(developed and supported here in Australia) that leverages and realises the Microsoft business intelligence stack.Seniors are also part of the team who design that in, who integrate it, and who make it dance. Our environment is flexible, agile, inclusive and growing.And we try hard to avoid bureaucracy - your good ideas get heard, road-tested, and put to work.

We'll teach you CALUMO (the software and the philosophy). If you've already got experience in data-warehousing, Analysis Services and MDX, great! If not, we'll teach you. Seniors start, in addition, with a solid background of years in corporate performance improvement. If you're like us, you're fonder of the toolbox than the first aid kit. You've led project teams and execution before. You've had experience in data-warehousing.
